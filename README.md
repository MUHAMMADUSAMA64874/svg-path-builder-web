# SVG Path Builder

A user-friendly tool for creating and animating SVG paths, built with Python and Tkinter. This project simplifies SVG text animation with an intuitive interface. Try it in your browser: [Live Demo](https://378f265b-daba-45b5-ba5c-06982d414c07-00-a4nk31ax7h2l.spock.replit.dev/).

## My Journey

I wanted to animate SVG text for a web project, but existing tools were complex or not beginner-friendly. So, I spent a month building this app with Python and Tkinter. Getting it to work in browsers was tricky—until I discovered Replit. It made deployment effortless, letting me share my tool with everyone. This project reflects my drive to make SVG design accessible.
