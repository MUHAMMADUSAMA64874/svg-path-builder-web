Features

Interactive Path Creation: Add and edit points to create SVG paths with Move (M) and Cubic Bezier (C) commands.
Text Along Path: Add customizable text that follows the path, with options for font size, color, letter spacing, and start offset.
Animation: Preview text animations along the path with adjustable duration and direction (left-to-right or right-to-left).
Color Customization: Change colors for the path, endpoints, control points, and handles via color pickers.
Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for better visibility, with enhanced dot contrast in dark mode.
Responsive Canvas: The SVG canvas scales dynamically to fit different screen sizes while maintaining a 800x600 viewBox.
Grid Controls: Toggle grid visibility, adjust grid size (10‚Äì100px), and enable snapping for precise point placement.
Import/Export: Load SVG files, save SVG output, copy SVG code to clipboard, or load images for tracing.
Undo/Redo: Support for undoing and redoing actions (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y).
Keyboard Navigation: Navigate modes and controls using arrow keys and shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+S to save).
Modern UI: Collapsible control panels, hover effects, and animations for a polished user experience.
