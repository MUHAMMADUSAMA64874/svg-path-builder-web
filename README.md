SVG Path Builder
 
A professional-grade tool for creating and editing SVG paths with text animation, built with Python and Tkinter. 🌟 This project was born from a month-long journey to solve the challenge of creating accessible, user-friendly SVG text animation tools. Deployed on Replit for easy browser access: Try it live! 🚀
📖 My Story
A while back, I hit a wall trying to create animated SVG text for a web project. Most tools I found were either too complex, had clunky interfaces, or weren’t beginner-friendly. 😓 As a developer who believes in making tech accessible, I decided to build my own solution.
I started with Python and Tkinter, crafting a desktop app to design and animate SVG paths. After weeks of hard work, I had a working prototype! 🎉 But I wanted to share it with the world via the browser. Converting it to a web app was time-intensive, so I turned to Replit—my first time using it. Its simplicity was a game-changer, letting me deploy the app online effortlessly. 🌐
This project is the result of perseverance, creative problem-solving, and a passion for empowering others. 🙌 Check out the features below and give it a spin!
